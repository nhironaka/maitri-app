Purpose
No one should have to suffer or die alone.

History
Maitri is a Sanskrit word meaning compassionate friendship and was formed as a response to the early AIDS Epidemic. We remain a hospice and
respite care facility. Maîtri is a 15 bed residence providing a high level of supervision and support for homeless/low income residents of San
Francisco living with HIV/AIDS. For the calendar year 2015 Maitri served 46 residents, 20 of whom passed away, 23 of whom were discharged and 
3 of whom remain in residence.We have been able to provide a safety and care and comfort to our residents who may not have otherwise had these
things at the end of there lives otherwise. we have also provided these things so that our residents can recover the health and strength and
return to the community. We offer compassion at a critical time for the most marginalized in our community.

Goals
The theme is data collect that will enable clear accurate and consistent reporting to our funders, help with fund raising and program planning
and allow for the development of a system that facilitates efficiency and ease for our dedicated volunteers.

Key Features
bridging reporting capabilities from old and hopefully phased out database, allowing social service staff to work in one database only, with 
some updated enhancements for data collection to ensure data collection

Devices
Tablets, Desktops

Target Audience
Volunteers approx. 60 , Staff of 53, and agencies that we as grantees report to.

Why
We are a small dedicated staff providing what we believe to be a vital service. We strive to be creative and flexible in meeting our diverse
client bases' needs. efficiency with our resources is key and currently we are in profound need of our technology to be efficient and providing 
us with accurate comprehensive information and capacity to communicate efficiently . Help with these gaps would make an immeasurable difference
to Maîtri. Thank you for your consideration.
